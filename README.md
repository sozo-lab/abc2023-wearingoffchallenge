# ABC 2023 Wearing-Off Challenge

**Wearing-off phenomenon** is experienced by Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients when their symptoms re-appear before their next medicine intake. Over time, the medicine’s effective time shortens, causing discomfort among PD patients. Thus, PD patients and clinicians must monitor and record the patient symptom changes for adequate treatment.
